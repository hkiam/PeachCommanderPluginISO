# pc-universal.sh — shared helpers so the external plugin bundles are built
# universal (arm64 + x86_64), matching the app itself.
#
# Sourced, not executed. Every Tools/build-*-plugin*.sh pulls this in and calls
# pc_swiftc / pc_clang instead of swiftc / clang.
#
# Why: the plugins used to be compiled for "$(uname -m)" only. Since the app is a
# universal build (project.yml sets ARCHS = arm64 x86_64), that produced a DMG
# whose app launched on Intel but whose plugins could not be loaded at all —
# silently dropping Git, Archive, WebDAV, Disk Map and the rest.
#
# clang takes several -arch flags in one invocation and emits a fat binary itself.
# swiftc does not: it accepts a single -target, so each slice is compiled
# separately and the results are merged with lipo.
#
# Override the slice list for a fast local build:
#   PC_PLUGIN_ARCHS=arm64 Tools/build-all-plugins.sh
